# Graphs
- A graph is a non-linear data structure used to represent relationships between objects.
- A graph is made of Vertices and Edges

## Types of Graphs
### Undirected Graph
- Edges have no direction.
### Direcrted Graph
- Edges have direction
### Weighted Graph
- Edges have weight
### Unweighted Graph
- Edges have no weight
### Cyclic Graph
-  Contains at least a cycle
### Acyclic Graph
- contains no cycles
### Connected Graph
- Every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
### Disconnected Graph
- Graph has multiple components.

# Graph Traversal
## BSF (Breadth First Search)
- Uses queue
- Level by level traversal
- Used in shortest path (unweighted)

## DFS (Depth First Search)
- Uses Stack/Recursion
- Goes deep first
- Used in cycle detection, topological sort.
