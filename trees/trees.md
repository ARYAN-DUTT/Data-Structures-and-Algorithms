# Tree -  Data Structure

## Important terms

### Degree of a Node
Number of children of that node.

## Degree of a Tree
Maximum degree of any node in the tree.

### Level of a Node (Starts from 1 at root)
Level of a node = distance from root + 1

### Depth of a Node (Edges) (Starts from 0 at root )
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

### Height of a Node (Edges)
Number of edges in the longest downward path from that node to a leaf.

### Height of a Tree (Edges)
Height of the root node

### Path Length (Edges)
Number of edges in a path.
Path A → C → D
Length = 2

## Tree Types
1. Binary Tree
2. Binary Search Tree **VERY IMPORTANT**
3. AVL Tree
4. B-Tree

## Operations of Tree

### Traversal
1. Pre-order Traversal -> Root,L,R
2. In-order Traversal -> L,Root,R
3. Post-order Traversal -> L,R,Root

## Binary Tree types

### Full Binary tree
A full binary tree is a special binary tree which allow only 0 or 2 childs.

### Perfect Binary tree
A Perfect binary tree allows only and only 2 children.

### Complete Binary Tree
Filling is always done from left to right.

### Degenerate or Pathological Tree
This allows only one child per node in any direction.

### Skewed Binary Tree (Not reffered as a type - its a problem)
A skewed binary tree allows only one child per node and in only one direction
1. Right skewed
2. Left skewed

### Balanced Binary tree
it is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the
left and the right subtree for each node is eoiter 0 or 1.
